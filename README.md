Scripts for child respirator analysis


This repository contains the raw data and scripts necessary to replicate the analyses performed for the associated paper (Nemeth et al, Quantitative Analysis of Facial Shape in Children to Support Respirator Design).

The dense and sparse landmark files used by these scripts can be otbained by application to the Facebase Hub (https://www.facebase.org/resources/human/) or by contacting the corresponding author (bhallgri@ucalgary.ca). Altnough these data are nonidentifiable, they are human subjects data and analyses of these data would have to be authorized by an approved human ethics review board.
